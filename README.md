# Game-Of-Nim
The objective of the mini-project code is to implement a simple game called the "23 Toothpick Game" where two players take turns removing 1 to 3 toothpicks from a pile of 23 toothpicks. The player who takes the last toothpick loses. The program includes a computer opponent with a strategy for picking toothpicks.
